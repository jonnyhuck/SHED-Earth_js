            <h1>SHED Earth</h1>
            <div class='underline'>
                <p>Welcome to SHED Earth. SHED refers to Schmidt hammer exposure dating: a technique
                that provides a cost-effective solution for dating the exposure of granite surfaces.
                This can be used to constrain the timing of past events, which permits a better
                understanding of the links between climate and landscape evolution.</p>

                <p>The approach is based upon a study by Tomkins et al. (2016)<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>,
                in which a statistically significant relationship was observed between the exposure ages
                <em>(derived from terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating)</em>, and Schmidt hammer rebound
                values (R-values) of 25 granitic surfaces from NW England and Scotland. This has recently
                been updated with 40 additional exposure ages from across Scotland and Ireland<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Calibration samples
                now span the last ~24 thousand years and encompass the entire post-Last
                Glacial Maximum (LGM) history of the British-Irish Ice Sheet. In addition, a new curve has
                recently been made available for the Pyrenees<sup><a href="#18">18</a></sup>, based on 54 TCN dated surfaces
                from across the mountain range. These new data appear consistent with previous
                research<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and indicate that this method can be applied
                successfully in contrasting climatic regimes. </p>

                <p>While further work is required to test these calibration curves in a range of landscapes
                <sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>, this approach is cost- and time-efficient and is of
                comparable accuracy to ages derived from terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>,
                making it useful for researchers and students alike.
                In turn, we hope that SHED will be of value to the Quaternary community, in that it can complement existing TCN studies
                in poorly dated regions and can be applied widely to undated glacial landforms. </p>

                    <h3>Calibration Curve</h3>

                    <small><p>The calibration curve used in SHED calculations is region-specific.
                    It is therefore important that you select the curve that is suitable for the location
                    in which your research is taking place, so that the appropriate curve may be selected.
                    If you would like to submit an additional curve to SHED-Earth, in order to allow you to

                    TCN dated surfaces from Scotland, NW England and Ireland.  These exposure ages are calculated using the time-dependent
                    Lm scaling scheme<sup><a href="#3">3,4</a></sup>, the Loch Lomond production rate
                    <sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup> and assuming 0 mm ka<sup>-1</sup> erosion. For full
                    details, see Tomkins et al. (2018)<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. It is anticipated that as
                    new calibration curves are constructed in similar well-dated regions, they will be made
                    available for use on this site.</p></small></div>

                    <h3>Production Rate</h3>
                    <small><p>The largest uncertainty involved in calculating TCN exposure ages is
                    the choice of production rate. As the SHED calibration is based on TCN exposure ages,
                    production rate controls the slope of the calibration curve and in turn, influences SH
                    exposure age estimates. As such, we provide the following production rates for calculating SH
                    exposure ages.</p>

                    <p>For both calibration curves, the underlying exposure age data is calculated using the globally-calibrated <sup>10</sup>Be production rate of
                    Borchers et al. (2016)<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>, the online calculators formerly known as the <a href="http://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/">CRONUS-Earth
                    online calculators</a>, as described by Balco et al. (2008)<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup>, the time-dependent Lm scaling scheme<sup><a href="#3">3,4</a></sup>
                    and assuming 0 mm ka<sup>-1</sup> erosion. While this is the default setting ("Balco v3"),
                    we also include ages calculated using the <a href="http://cronus.cosmogenicnuclides.rocks/2.0/">CRONUS Earth Web Calculator (v2)</a>, as described by
                    Marrero et al. (2016)<sup><a href="#25">25</a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>To supplement these approaches, we also provide a range of suitable locally-calibrated <sup>10</sup>Be production rates from the British Isles.
                    These include the Loch Lomond production rate (LLPR; 3.99 ± 0.06 atoms g<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>; Fabel et al., 2012) <sup><a href="#20">20</a></sup>
                    which is based on <sup>10</sup>Be concentrations from erratic boulders on the terminal
                    moraine of the Younger Dryas Loch Lomond glacier advance, the timing of which is independently constrained
                    by <sup>14</sup>C ages derived from a varve chronology (MacLeod et al., 2011)<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>. This
                    calibration dataset is one of the most widely used local production rates in the British Isles.</p>

                    <p> In addition, we include the Rannoch Moor production rate(RM-PR; 3.95 ± 0.11 atoms g<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>;
                    Putnam et al., 2019<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>), which is based on <sup>10</sup>Be
                    concentrations from boulders deposited on a glacial moraine belt on Rannoch Moor, central Scottish Highlands,
                    the timing of which is independently constrained by proximal <sup>14</sup>C ages (Bromley et al., 2014<sup><a href="#19">19</a></sup>) and
                    <sup>14</sup>C ages from outlet glaciers of the West Highland ice field. However, it should be noted that the
                    validity of this production rate has recently been questioned<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>Finally, we provide the Glen Roy production rate (GRPR; 4.31 ± 0.21 atoms g<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>;
                    Small and Fabel, 2015<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>) which is derived from assumed ages of tephra within a floating
                    varve chronology (MacLeod et al., 2015<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup>). Collectively, the LLPR and GRPR provide upper
                    and lower limits on the range of local production rates from the British Isles.</p></small>

                    <h5>R Values</h5>
                    <small><p>Users should input raw R-value data in the format displayed below.
                    Inputs include sample IDs and locations (latitude/longitude) which are stored

                    exposure ages) are not recorded. While we encourage users to record 30 R-values
                    per surface to ensure statistically significant results, the tool will also
                    operate on smaller sample sizes. This tool performs instrument and age calibration

                    <h5>Instrument Calibration Values</h5>
                    <small><p>In order to ensure that the Schmidt hammer is functioning correctly and
                    yielding the same R-value on an identical rock surface, even after hundreds or
                    thousands of impacts<sup><a href="#10">10</a></sup>, users should test their Schmidt Hammer using a suitable
                    surface before and after sampling.</p>

                    <p>In order to test Schmidt hammer functionality, a concrete test anvil (<a href="https://www.yorksurvey.co.uk/concrete-testing-anvil-c2x22546678">example here</a>)
                    is typically used to assess deviation from a standard value (N-type SH = 81 ± 2). This is a good approach to <strong>test</strong>
                    functionality because operator variance is minimal (e.g. identical contact point and angle of operation) and because
                    the anvils construction minimises wear following repeated impacts. In turn, the anvil typically returns consistent readings at the upper end of the
                    functional range of the Schmidt hammer (~81 R-value). However, if functionality is compromised (i.e. measured R-value < standard R-value),
                    then it is necessary to calibrate R-values measured in the field.</p>

                    <p>Previous studies have advocated the use of the concrete
                    test anvil<sup><a href="#10">10,11</a></sup>. However, an implicit assumption in the test anvil calibration procedure is
                    that the difference (%) between the specified anvil standard and the recorded average
                    is consistent throughout the operational range of the Schmidt Hammer i.e. a 20% R-value
                    difference between two Schmidt hammers as recorded using the test anvil should also be
                    replicated on a range of natural rock surfaces. However, this is not supported by evidence<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
                    as the difference between Schmidt hammers as recorded using the test anvil is not maintained
                    throughout the tools’ operational range but decreases significantly as the surface
                    R-value decreases. As a result, this method over-estimates R-values for surfaces typically
                    tested by Quaternary researchers<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>

                    <p>For very hard rock surfaces (R-values: ≥ 70), the test
                    anvil method may be more effective, as variation between Schmidt hammers as recorded on
                    the anvil is probably representative of variability on sampled rock surfaces. However,
                    for the vast majority of rock surfaces tested by Quaternary researchers (R-values: ≤ 60),
                    the anvil method will significantly overestimate R-values<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. Thus, users should perform
                    instrument calibration using a calibration surface which is within the range of their
                    sample data and that is of sufficient size<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>,
                    that is free of surface discontinuities<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>
                    and lichen<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> and that is easily accessible. Users should input pre- and post-calibration
                    values for their chosen surface and input their raw R-value data in chronological order
                    (related to the time of sampling). R-values will be corrected assuming linear R-value
                    drift<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> based on the variance between pre- and post-calibration values and the number
                    of individual R-values. This procedure is most effective when periods between calibration tests are short<sup><a href="#15">15</a></sup>.

                    to a verifiable standard (e.g. University of Manchester calibration boulder)
                    is necessary to minimise potential errors in SHED age estimates.</p>

                    <p>For the British Isles SHED curve, users should test their Schmidt Hammer using the University of Manchester
                    calibration boulder (R-Value = 48.08 ± 0.82)<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup> and input their mean R-Value here.
                    For the Pyrenees SHED curve, users should test their Schmidt Hammer using one of the three calibration
                    surfaces provided (R-Values: Maladeta = 52.60 ± 0.74; Bassies = 44.14 ± 0.60; and Carlit = 48.67 ± 0.65) and
                    input their mean R-Value here. A correction factor (%) is applied to all user R-values when the input value is less than the reference value - uncertainty, or
                    more than the reference value + uncertainty..</p>

                    <p>Users who have not completed age calibration using one of these age calibration surfaces
                    should use the default value. As such, no correction for variance between
                    different Schmidt Hammers or between users will be made. This may be appropriate if users have calibrated
                    their Schmidt Hammer using one of the boulder or bedrock surfaces reported in
                    previous publications<sup><a href="#1">1,2</a></sup>, although we advocate
                    caution with this approach<sup><a href="#17">17</a></sup>. Although
                    variance between Schmidt Hammers is usually small for surfaces with R-values of ≤ 60,
                    variance can exceed ~10% for older Schmidt Hammers and should be accounted for<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
